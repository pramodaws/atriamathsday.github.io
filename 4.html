<h1>Math skill in an engineer:</h1>
<p>A Mini Project Competition for the pre-final year engineering students is planned with an intention to nurture the skills to express mathematical solutions through any of the following technologies. The projects are exhibited to nearby school and PU students through online which enhance the interest of mathematics in a technical way.  Following are the technologies applied in the projects:  
</p><br>

 <p>The concepts of Web applications can be merged with Mathematics by using the:</p>
     <p1><li>Boolean Logic which could be used to write the conditional statements of the business logic.</li>
   </p1><br>
       <p2><li>Statistical models can be used in Web applications which could be used for analytics of the data.</li>
    </p2><br><hr>

   <p> The concepts of DBMS can be merged with Mathematics by using the:</p>
    <p1><li> <u>	Set Theory </u>markconcepts for joining the tables in the database</li></p1><br>
    <p2><li><u>	Boolean Logic </u>which could be used for database indexing.</li></p2><br>
    <p3><li> <u>	Relational Algebra</u> to write the queries.</li></p3><br>
    <p4><li><u >	Relational Calculus</u> to write the complex queries of DBMS</li></p4><br>
    </p><br><hr>

    <p> The concepts of Computer Graphics can be merged with Mathematics by using:</p>
    <p1><li><u>Homogenous transformations</u> could be used for 2D and 3D transformations</li><br><br>
    <p2>  <li>The ideas of <u>Linear Algebra</u> are used throughout computer graphics. In fact, any area that concerns itself with numerical representations of geometry often will collect together numbers such as x,y,z positions into mathematical objects called vectors</li>.</p2><br><br>
    <p3>	<li><u>Vectors and</u> a related mathematical object called a <u>matrix</u> are used all the time in graphics. The language of vectors and matrices is an elegant way to describe (among other things) the way in which an object may be rotated, shifted (translated), or made larger or smaller (scaled). Linear algebra is usually offered either in an advanced high school class or in college.</li> </p3><br>
   <br> 
   <p4><li><u>	Bezier Curves</u> are implemented in Computer Graphics Laboratory.</li></p4>
