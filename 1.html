<h1>Make a math model : </h1>
<p>Modeling with mathematics is the practice of making sense of the world through a mathematical perspective.  This competition provides more opportunities to identify mathematical problems in the world, determine what information will help them solve a problem, develop mathematical models in an approachable way and revise their models to more closely predict real world phenomena.
</p>
<p1><u>Round1</u>: All the participants will be  asked with quiz questions and the participants with proper answer will be selected to next round</p1>
   <br><br>

              <p3><u>Round3</u>: All the participants will make a model which gives sense to mathematics</p3>
               <br><br>
               <p4><u>Round4</u>: everyone will justify their mathematical model </p4><br><br><br>
